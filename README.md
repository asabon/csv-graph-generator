# CSV Graph Generator

[Japanese (日本語)](./README_ja.md)


A GitHub Action that automatically generates graph images from CSV files. It parses the input CSV data and creates visualizations (like bar charts or line charts) using Chart.js, saving them as image files. This is useful for including dynamic data visualizations in your issue comments, pull request descriptions, or report files.


## Features

*   **CSV Parsing**: Reads data from a specified CSV file.
*   **Graph Generation**: Generates various types of charts (bar, line, etc.) using Chart.js.
*   **Customizable**: Supports configuration for output file path, graph type, and title.
*   **Easy Integration**: Can be easily added to any GitHub Actions workflow.

### Sample Output

Here are some examples of graphs generated by this action:

**Bar Chart**
<img src="assets/bar-chart-sample.png" width="400" alt="Bar Chart Sample">

**Line Chart**
<img src="assets/line-chart-sample.png" width="400" alt="Line Chart Sample">

**Pie Chart**
<img src="assets/pie-chart-sample.png" width="400" alt="Pie Chart Sample">

## Usage

Add the following step to your workflow configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/generate-graph.yml`).

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Generate Graph from CSV
    uses: asabon/csv-graph-generator@v1
    with:
      csv-file: 'data/metrics.csv'
      output-file: 'report/graph.png'
      graph-type: 'bar'
      title: 'Monthly Metrics'
```

### Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `csv-file` | Path to the input CSV file. | **Yes** | N/A |
| `output-file` | Path where the output image will be saved. | **Yes** | `graph.png` |
| `graph-type` | Type of graph to generate (`bar`, `line`, `pie`, etc.). | No | `bar` |
| `title` | Title of the graph to be displayed. | No | `''` |

### Example CSV Format

The action expects a simple CSV format where the first row contains headers. By default, the first column is used as **labels** (X-axis) and the second column as **data values** (Y-axis).

```csv
Label,Value
January,10
February,20
March,15
April,25
```
